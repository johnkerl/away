# cloud-dev-temp

This is temporary/WIP -- things I am using day-in-day-out today, warts and all. Will improve over time. Some things will disappear on dockerizing/hardening etc.

Here are what I actually use to bring up a local stack at present: seven scripts starting with `ls*` for “local stack”.

* Scripts 1,3,6,7 result in servers running so I have four terminal windows open.
* I don’t use `docker-compose` everywhere — some of the very nice stuff on https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Cloud-REST/pull/1879 isn’t working quite right on MacOS yet so I run the UI servers outside of Docker at the moment.
* This is Code Which Runs Today. Over time it will get optimized.
